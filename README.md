# SNESE - SNES Emulator with Built-in Game Maker

A Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) emulator with an integrated game maker, implemented entirely in pure C for educational purposes.

## Overview

SNESE is an educational project aimed at developing a cycle-accurate SNES emulator while providing tools for creating and modifying SNES games. The project emphasizes understanding retro hardware emulation, low-level programming, and interactive tool development.

### Key Features (Planned)

- **Pure C Implementation**: Written in ANSI C (C89/C90) for maximum portability
- **Cycle-Accurate Emulation**: Accurate reproduction of SNES hardware behavior
- **Built-in Game Maker**: Runtime tools for creating and modifying ROM-based games
- **ML Graphics Upscaling**: Machine learning-based upscaling for enhanced visual quality
- **Educational Focus**: Designed to teach emulation concepts and low-level programming
- **Cross-Platform**: Targets Linux, Windows (via MinGW), and other platforms

## Architecture

The emulator will emulate the following SNES components:

- **CPU**: Ricoh 5A22 (65c816 core, 3MHz)
- **PPU**: Picture Processing Unit (backgrounds, sprites, Mode 7)
- **APU**: Sony SPC-700 for audio processing
- **Memory**: 128KB RAM with cartridge mapping (LoROM/HiROM)
- **Input**: Joypad controller support

## Prerequisites

- C compiler (GCC or Clang recommended)
- Make build system
- Basic knowledge of:
  - C programming (pointers, structs, bit manipulation)
  - Assembly language (6502/65c816 ISA)
  - SNES architecture

## Building

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kamer1337/SNESE.git
cd SNESE

# Build the project
make

# Run the emulator with ROM selection GUI
./snesemu

# Or run with a specific ROM file
./snesemu rom.sfc
```

## Usage

### ROM Selection GUI (New!)

Simply run the emulator without arguments to launch the ROM selection interface:

```bash
./snesemu
```

The GUI will automatically scan the `roms/` directory and present a list of available ROM files.
Use the number keys to select a ROM and press Enter.

**Note:** Place your ROM files (.sfc or .smc) in the `roms/` directory before running.

### Running the Emulator with a Specific ROM

```bash
./snesemu <rom_file.sfc>
```

### Game Maker Mode

The built-in Game Maker provides comprehensive ROM editing tools:

```bash
./snesemu --maker <rom_file.sfc>
```

**Available Editors:**

1. **Tile Editor**
   - View and edit 8x8 pixel tiles (2bpp format)
   - Pixel-by-pixel editing with color selection
   - Palette switching and zoom controls
   - Export/import tile data

2. **Sprite Editor**
   - Manage up to 128 sprites
   - Position control (X, Y coordinates)
   - Tile assignment and palette selection
   - Horizontal/vertical flip controls
   - Direct OAM (Object Attribute Memory) access

3. **Tilemap Editor**
   - Edit background layers (BG1-BG4)
   - WASD cursor navigation
   - Tile placement with paint mode
   - View tilemap area around cursor
   - Layer switching

4. **Palette Editor**
   - Edit 16 palettes of 16 colors each
   - RGB value editing (0-31 per channel)
   - Hexadecimal color input (BGR555 format)
   - Full palette preview
   - Export/import palette files

5. **Script Editor**
   - Batch ROM modifications
   - Commands: SET (byte), FILL (range), COPY (data)
   - Load/save script files
   - Syntax help and documentation

**Documentation:**
- See [docs/TUTORIAL.md](docs/TUTORIAL.md) for a comprehensive beginner's guide
- See [docs/GAME_MAKER_GUIDE.md](docs/GAME_MAKER_GUIDE.md) for complete usage instructions
- See [docs/PHASE_5_COMPLETION.md](docs/PHASE_5_COMPLETION.md) for technical details
- See [docs/PERFORMANCE.md](docs/PERFORMANCE.md) for optimization and profiling

### ML Graphics Upscaling

The emulator includes machine learning-based graphics upscaling to enhance visual quality:

```bash
# The upscaling is integrated into the PPU rendering pipeline
# Supports 2x, 3x, and 4x upscaling with ML enhancement
```

**Upscaling Modes:**
- Standard nearest-neighbor (fast, pixel-perfect)
- Bilinear interpolation (smooth)
- ML-enhanced upscaling (preserves pixel art aesthetic)

**Features:**
- Pretrained model weights optimized for retro graphics
- Edge-preserving filters
- Configurable sharpness and anti-aliasing
- Real-time performance at 60 FPS

**Documentation:**
- See [docs/ML_UPSCALING.md](docs/ML_UPSCALING.md) for complete technical details
- Run `tests/upscaler_demo` to see upscaling in action

### Display Options

```bash
# Display ROM information only
./snesemu --info rom.sfc

# Run with debug output
./snesemu --debug rom.sfc

# Show help
./snesemu --help
```

## Testing

Legal SNES ROMs are required for testing. You can use:
- Public domain ROMs
- Homebrew ROMs
- Test ROMs (e.g., blargg's test suite)

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Build with profiling enabled
make PROFILE=1

# Build in debug mode
make DEBUG=1
```

**Test Coverage:**
- 28 automated unit tests
- 100% test pass rate
- Tests for cartridge, script, and memory modules
- See [tests/README.md](tests/README.md) for details
